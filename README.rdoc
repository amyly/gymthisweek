== GYM THIS WEEK

One-page app that counts the number of times you've worked out in a week, based on your Foursquare checkins.

By default, the app counts visits to "Gym / Fitness Center" locations. You can customize the app to also accept all checkins mentioning #run, #kickball, #bhangra â€“ or any other hashtag you wish to track.

Created as part of [General Assembly](http://generalssemb.ly)'s 10-week [Back-End Web Development](http://generalssemb.ly/education/back-end-web-development) course.
