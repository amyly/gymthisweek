== GYM THIS WEEK

One-page app that counts the number of times you've worked out in a week, based on your Foursquare checkins.

By default, the app counts visits to "Gym / Fitness Center" locations. You can customize the app to also accept all checkins mentioning #run, #kickball, #bhangra – or any other hashtag you wish to track.

Created as part of <a href="http://generalssemb.ly>General Assembly</a>'s 10-week <a href="http://generalssemb.ly/education/back-end-web-development">Back-End Web Development</a> course.
