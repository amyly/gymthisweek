== GYM THIS WEEK

One-page app that counts the number of times you've worked out in a week, based on your Foursquare history.

By default, the app counts visits to "Gym / Fitness Center" locations. You can customize the app to also accept all checkins mentioning #run, #kickball, #bhangra â€“ or any other hashtag you wish to track.
